# Roblox-Raycast-Renderer
A larger project that combined several of the programming concepts I had learned before into one gigantic project with several iterations before I was satisfied with it. Most of the code is on the client as a "SurfaceGui" for each machine.

Note: Due to the nature of downloading the files, the rendering code is in src/StarterGui as separate .rbxmx files

Primary IDE: Roblox Game Engine

Primary Language: Lua
